Introduction
============

``PLD_Workflow`` is a Python package providing an interface for recording the thin film growth condition of the Pulsed Laser Deposition experiment and managing recorded plume images with a high-speed camera.
Also, functions to evaluate plumes are provided by plotting metrics of plumes such as area and velocity.

Motivation
********** 

The PLD growth condition is sensitive to numerous parameters like temperature, pressure, or target material. A system that can track growth conditions and evaluate the growth in real-time is desired to get a consistent and satisfying result. 

Therefore, this package enables experimentalists to analyze experimental conditions statistically and conduct plume dynamics analysis in real-time.
